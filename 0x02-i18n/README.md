#  ðŸ§®Internationalization (i18n) with Flask

This project explores the process of creating internationalized (i18n) web applications using the Flask web framework.

Internationalization is the process of designing and developing a product or application that can be easily adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes. This is an important consideration for web applications that aim to reach a global audience.

The tasks in this project will guide you through the foundational steps of building an i18n-enabled Flask application, starting with a basic setup and progressing towards more advanced techniques.

##  ðŸ§®Tasks to Complete

1. **Basic Flask App**
   - The file [0-app.py](0-app.py) contains a Python script that sets up a basic Flask application with the following requirements:
     - Defines a single `/` route that renders an [index.html](templates/0-index.html) template
     - The template displays "Welcome to Holberton" as the page title (`<title>`) and "Hello world" as the main header (`<h1>`)
   - This task establishes a starting point for the i18n-related work to come, providing a simple Flask app structure to build upon.

2. **Internationalize Content**
